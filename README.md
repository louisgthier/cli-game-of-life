# cli-game-of-life

A terminal-based Conway's Game of Life
This project combines two classic concepts: Conway's Game of Life and a player-controlled character in a terminal-based environment. It allows you to interact with a grid-based simulation where cells follow the rules of Conway's Game of Life, and you can control a character's movement within the same grid.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- The 'keyboard' module (used for player control)
- The 'colorama' module (used for colored terminal output)

You can install the required Python modules using pip:

```pip install keyboard colorama```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the 'game_of_life.py' script:

```python game_of_life.py```

4. You will see a grid-based simulation where cells evolve following Conway's Game of Life rules. Additionally, you can control a character's movement (represented as 'O') within the grid using the arrow keys.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the character ('O') within the grid.

- Observe the grid-based simulation to see how cells evolve over time based on Conway's Game of Life rules.
